/**
 * Resolve the ffmpeg binary used to encode browser-test replay exports.
 *
 * The devbox image bakes ffmpeg in; sandboxes still on the older image (and
 * dev machines) may not have it. Callers report FFMPEG_UNAVAILABLE up front
 * rather than discovering the gap after a multi-minute render. Only a found
 * binary is cached — an agent can `apt-get install ffmpeg` mid-session and the
 * next export should see it.
