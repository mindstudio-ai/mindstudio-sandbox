 * Tunnel-side navigation for automation `navigate` steps.
 *
 * Runs inside the tunnel (Node) against the puppeteer Page owned by the
 * BrowserSupervisor. Navigation used to execute in-page (browser-agent), where
 * a hard load tears down the executor mid-batch — the WS client and all state
 * die with the document, which is what the stash/resume protocol and the
 * proxy's disconnect-reconcile machinery existed to survive. Executing it here
 * means WS batches never span a page boundary we created: the proxy's dispatch
 * already waits for the browser-agent's reconnect before the next batch.
 *
 * It also reports the URL actually landed on. The in-page path returned a
 * blind 'ok', which hid app-side redirects from the caller — a QA agent
 * navigating to a public page and getting bounced by an auth wall saw 'ok'
 * and then a snapshot of the wrong page.

 * page is parked on chrome-error://chromewebdata/ (after an aborted nav),
 * resolving against it yields chrome-error://.../<path> → net::ERR_ABORTED,
