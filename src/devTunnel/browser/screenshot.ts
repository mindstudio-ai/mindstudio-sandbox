 *
 * Cost model, because it drives the timeouts here: the sandbox browser runs with
 * --disable-gpu, so a page that renders continuously rasterizes in software, and
 * every CDP step of a capture then costs roughly a frame — a `page.evaluate` has
 * to be scheduled on a main thread busy rasterizing, and the capture waits for a
 * committed frame. Measured on a WebGL page at 7fps: ~3s per evaluate, 3.6s to
 * capture the viewport, 8.0s to capture full-page. Nothing is wedged in that
 * situation, it is all just slow, so the deadlines below are a budget shared
 * across the steps rather than a hang detector: each step spends what it needs,
 * the optional ones drop out when the budget runs low, and the module's job is to
 * fail inside that budget without leaving work running in Chrome afterwards.

/**
 * Prepare a non-fullPage (viewport) capture by scrolling a target element — or
 * an absolute Y offset — into view via CDP `page.evaluate`, i.e. the *same*
 * context the screenshot is taken in, so the scroll and the capture can't race
 * (unlike a scroll issued over the WebSocket browser-agent and a separate CDP
 * capture). Then waits for at least one composited frame so the scrolled layout
 * has painted before the shot.
 *
 * No scroll target means nothing to settle, so it returns immediately, and the
 * paint wait only runs when the scroll actually moved the page. Each skipped
 * `page.evaluate` matters: on a page rendering in software it costs about 3s,
 * because the call has to be scheduled on a main thread that is busy
 * rasterizing (the round trip dominates; capping the wait *inside* the page
 * changes nothing, measured). When nothing moved there is no scroll to race
 * with, and `Page.captureScreenshot` waits for a committed frame on its own.
 *
 * Best-effort — all errors swallowed.
